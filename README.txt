This Splunk add-on collects identity, access, and infrastructure metadata directly from Red Hat Identity Management (IdM) and FreeIPA environments. It provides real-time visibility into domain objects and security configurations, enabling identity auditing, security monitoring, and centralized insight into authentication infrastructure.

This is an add-on powered by the Splunk Add-on Builder.
